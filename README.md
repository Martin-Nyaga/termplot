# Termplot

Termplot is a simple terminal plotting tool for visualising streaming data.

See the demo on Asciinema:

[![Termplot Demo Asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/370325.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/3rzeUSXp2fRjnErX0p3SptP5e)

## Overview

Termplot draws trendlines of data piped into the command from standard input.
It's handy for quickly visualising streaming data in your terminal and works
with any numeric data you can pipe into stdin.

## Installation

The tool is a ruby gem and can be installed with:

    $ gem install termplot

## Usage

The basic usage is simple:

```
{command} | termplot [OPTIONS]
```

`{command}` is any command that will periodically output numbers to standard out
delimited by a newline. You can also instead specify a command to run at a given
interval to produce the data.

Options and examples are given below. All command line options are
optional.

```
Usage: termplot [OPTIONS]
  -r, --rows ROWS          Number of rows in the chart window (default: 19)

  -c, --cols COLS          Number of cols in the chart window (default: 80)

  -t, --title TITLE        Title of the series (default: 'Series')

      --line-style STYLE   Line style. Options are: line (default), heavy-line, dot, star, x

      --color COLOR        Series color, specified as ansi 16-bit color name:
                           (i.e. black, light_black, red (default), light_red, green,
                           light_green, yellow, light_yellow, blue, light_blue, magenta,
                           light_magenta, cyan, light_cyan, white, light_white, default)

      --command COMMAND    Enables command mode, where input is received by executing
                           the specified command in intervals rather than from stdin

      --interval INTERVAL  The interval at which to run the specified command in
                           command mode in milliseconds (default: 1000)

  -h, --help               Display this help message
```
Note: Make sure to wrap your command in single quotes when using `--command` if
you use shell variables (e.g. `$1`) in your command.

## Examples

#### Sine wave

```
for i in $(seq 500); do \
  echo $i | awk '{ print sin($0/10) }'; \
  sleep 0.5; \
  done | termplot -t "Sin(x)"
```

#### Memory usage (%)
```
termplot --command 'free | awk "NR==2 { print ($3/$2) * 100 }"' \
  -t "Memory (% used)" --color light_magenta --line-style heavy-line
```

#### Real time stock ticker

(Using [ticker.sh](https://github.com/pstadler/ticker.sh)) ðŸ˜‰:

```
termplot --command 'NO_COLOR=1 ticker.sh MSFT | awk "{ print $2 }"' \
  --interval 10000 -t "MSFT" --color light_green
```

## Notes

- The command should work just fine if you have a monospaced unicode font.
  Tested on linux, and should work on MacOS too. Not too sure about windows.
- The samples received are plotted in sequence order, and there is no notion of
  temporal spacing. So even if the time between samples is inconsistent, they
  will be plotted with the same amount of space between them.

## Background

I recently needed to be able to monitor the number of open TCP connections on my
linux machine. I could get the data I needed from `ss` with some text processing
but I didn't have a quick and easy way to eyeball the overall trend.

I mainly work with ruby, so taking
inspiration from fantastic libraries like [Unicode Plots
(Julia)](https://github.com/Evizero/UnicodePlots.jl) and
[Termeter (Go)](https://github.com/atsaki/termeter), I decided to build something in
ruby.

Now with termplot, it's as easy as:

```
termplot --command 'ss -s | head -n1 | cut -d" " -f2' --interval 500 -t "TCP Connections"
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. There are
some simple test commands in the Rakefile which are useful for development. To
install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`.
